### Detecting structural variants/copy-number variants present in a genome (here,yeast) from next generation sequencing data

These scripts can be used for following purpose(s) :

**Simulations:**
  + simulate and detect structural variants(SV) in reference genomes (.pbs file), 
  + evaluate performances of tools/packages used in SV detection based on False discovery rate (FDR), precision, sensitivity and F-score (.Rmd file), and
  + gives an overview of how many tools successfully detects total of simulated SVs.
  
**Real/Lab data:**
  + detect SVs present in yeast genomes.
  + plot read depth vs position for variants detected in genomes as well as whole chromosomes.
  + gives an overview of how many tools successfully detects total of SVs present in genomes.
